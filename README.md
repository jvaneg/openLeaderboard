# openLeaderboard
Self-serve generalized leaderboard website using the Elo rating system. Allows users
to create their own leaderboards for any activity that can be modelled as a one-vs-one
competition. Uses a MySQL database to store user data, with a PHP backend and a
JS/CSS/HTML frontend. Currently deployed on AWS [here](http://ec2-34-216-165-130.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/).
